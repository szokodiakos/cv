    "text": "Full-stack Software Engineer mainly with backend and database orientation. Passionate about software quality (UX design, design patterns, clean coding, unit testing, linting). Fluent in JavaScript, although believes polyglot development is a good philosophy as engineers should not be locked into a single language and should always adapt the technology according to the problem. Likes to try out new libraries/languages, write blog posts and hack together useful solutions."
